# Indian-Airlines-Ticket-Price-Analysis
Analyzing Indian Airlines ticket prices using Python involves several steps, including data collection, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building predictive models. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to performing this analysis:

Step 1: Data Collection
To analyze Indian Airlines ticket prices, you'll need a dataset. You can use publicly available datasets, scrape data from airline websites, or use APIs. A popular dataset available on Kaggle for this purpose is "Flight Price Prediction."

Step 2: Data Preprocessing
After collecting the data, you need to clean and preprocess it. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves visualizing and summarizing the main characteristics of the data. It helps in understanding patterns, correlations, and outliers.

Step 4: Model Building
Build predictive models to understand the factors affecting ticket prices and to make future price predictions. Commonly used models include Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.

Step 5: Model Evaluation
Evaluate the performance of your models using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
